# disjoint_interval_range

A Simple Disjoint Interval range (right now with bugs, till I fix them) data structure.
I maintain the range start and end in vectors, and the ordering in maps.

fuzzer.cpp generates input for fuzzer_inp_test.cpp
inp_failed_seg_fault is an input generated by the fuzzer that caused a segfault (and will be part of the regression)

Compilation steps are as follows

1. use this to compile and run the basic tests 
g++ interval_range.cpp -DIncludeMain  

2. generate input using the fuzzer
g++ fuzzer.cpp > inp_fuzzer

3. run the fuzz input with 
g++ fuzz_input_test.cpp  interval_range.cpp

4. feed the fuzzed input to binary from step 4
./a.out < inp_fuzzer > op

Look for the seg_fault and try to fix
